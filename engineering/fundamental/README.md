# Fundamental

We have our own standard for our engineers. It happens at all levels. Especially, the entry point is more important to keep everything in shape.
This is a part of our playbook to guide our engineer to have a basic setup and share the same fundamental. If you are already at a certain level, follow the main playbook instead.

The fundamental composes neccessary knowledge, practices, and setup for you to quickly reach the lowest bar. We strongly recommend you to go through and follow the fundamental guideline.
